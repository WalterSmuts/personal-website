<h2> About </h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm Walter. Up above you can see my face. Yup, that one. A little vain, but
what do you expect when visiting a site called "waltersmuts.com"? I ike being
transparent and straightforward. I believe it makes my life simpler.
</p>

<p>
I'm a software engineer with a kink for mathematics. My formal education is in
engineering, where I naturally gravitated towards signal processing. More
recently, I've become intererested in formal verification and type theory. My
current plans are to further my education in one or both of these directions.
</p>

The stories I hear of Bell Labs in the 20th century really excite me. It sounds
like the kind of place I'd enjoy working. If you're a prospective employer and
this matches your workplace description, please email me at smuts [dot] walter
[at] gmail.com.
